We import the necessary TensorFlow libraries and MobileNetV2 model.
We load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model, which was trained on the ImageNet dataset.
Replace 'your_image.jpg' with the path to the image you want to classify. Ensure the image is in the same directory as your script or provide the full path.
We preprocess the image by resizing it to 224x224 pixels and applying the required preprocessing steps.
We make predictions on the preprocessed image using the MobileNetV2 model.
Finally, we display the top 5 predictions, including the class label and the associated confidence score.
