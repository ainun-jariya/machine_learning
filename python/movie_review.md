We import necessary libraries from scikit-learn.
We create a small dataset of movie reviews and their corresponding labels (positive or negative).
We use the CountVectorizer to convert the text data into numerical features.
The data is split into training and testing sets.
We train a text classifier using Multinomial Naive Bayes.
The classifier is used to make predictions on the test data.
We evaluate the classifier's accuracy and generate a classification report, which includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
